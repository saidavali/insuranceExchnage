                        <h4>Why Life insurance…</h4>
                        <p>Life insurance is a risk management tool that protects your loved ones if you die unexpectedly. If you cover any of your dependents’ expenses, then having adequate life insurance coverage makes sure they’re not financially strapped if you’re no longer around to do so. The life insurance death benefit protects your beneficiaries from shouldering an immense financial burden, and can pay for college, dependent care, final expenses, and other debts that your family could be responsible for if you die.</p>

                    <h4>Term Life Insurance</h4>				
                    <p>Term life insurance lasts for a set number of years before it expires. If you die before the term is up, a set amount of money, known as the death benefit, is paid to your designated beneficiary. </p>
                    <p>Term life is considered the simplest, most accessible insurance policy. When you make your payments (known as your premium), you’re paying for the death benefit that goes to your beneficiaries in the event of your death. The death benefit can be paid out as a lump sum, a monthly payment, or an annuity. Most people elect to receive their death benefit as a lump sum.</p>
                    <p>Term life insurance policies are more affordable than other types of life insurance policies, usually costing $30-40 a month for a 30-year, $500,000 policy for healthy people in their 20s and 30s. The policy expires at the end of the term, which can last up to 30 years.</p>

                    <h4>Whole Life Insurance</h4>	
                    <p>Whole life insurance, on the other hand, is considered a permanent life insurance policy because it does not expire. It has a death benefit but also a cash value, which is a tax-deferred savings account that is included in the policy. The cash value accrues interest at a predetermined fixed rate. Each month, a certain portion of your premium will go into the cash value of the policy, which offers a guaranteed rate of return (the exact amount that goes into savings is determined by your individual policy).</p>
                    <p> The policy's cash value grows over time.Due to the fees and the extra feature, a whole life insurance policy can cost <strong>five to 15 times</strong> as much as a term life policy for the same death benefit amount.Whole life lasts for as long as you pay the premiums. However, the cash value component can make whole life more complex than term life because you have to consider surrender fees, taxes, and interest as well as other stipulations. Still, it may be worth it if you need the cash value to cover things like endowments or estate plans, which might benefit from the greater options that a whole life policy provides.</p>

                        <h4>Universal Life Insurance</h4>	
                        <p>Universal life insurance has a cash value, just like a whole life insurance policy. Your premiums go toward both the cash value and the death benefit. But there’s a twist: You can change the premium and death benefit amounts without getting a new policy. Basically, although you have a minimum premium to keep the policy in force, you can use the cash value to pay that premium. That means if you have enough money in the cash value, you can use that to skip premium payments entirely, letting the accrued interest do the work.</p>
                        <p>But the cash value of a universal life insurance policy has an interest rate that’s sensitive to current market interest rates. If the interest rate being credited to your policy decreases to the minimum rate, your premium would have to increase to offset the reduced cash value. You can also adjust the death benefit within limits outlined in your policy. Increasing it may subject you to further underwriting, while there may be fees to decrease it. If your financial situation changes, the ability to change the death benefit amount within your policy is appealing. While this can be done with term life insurance policies, this feature is one of the main selling points of a universal policy.This flexibility makes universal life insurance attractive to some people, but it’s also confusing. Unlike term life insurance, where you pay a certain amount every month or year and know what the death benefit will be, shifting premiums and death benefits are more complex than what most people need, and it comes at an added cost.</p>

                        <h4>Variable life insurance</h4>
                        <p>Variable life insurance is similar to whole life insurance in that they both have a cash value, but the functions of the cash values are quite different.With a whole life insurance policy, the cash value component is a savings account. That’s why, although the growth might be small compared to other investment options, there is a guaranteed minimum rate. It also includes dividend payments from the life insurance company.</p>
                        <p>A variable life insurance cash value is more opt to investing. The money paid into it goes into a series of mutual fund-like sub-accounts where you can get some decent growth, but you can also lose money depending on the market. The cash value is more or less placed in the stock market.
                        While this makes variable life insurance policies a better investment option than whole life insurance policies — the potential for higher, tax-deferred growth makes it a "super-IRA" — you can only invest in the sub-accounts available through your policy. That means you don’t get to choose from the wide variety of mutual funds that are available on the open market.</p>
                        <p>While fees can be lower with a variable life insurance policy than a whole life policy, the product is riskier. Why? The same reason investing in stocks is risky: Most people don’t know much about the stock market and don’t know enough to make changes in their investment. There’s too much management for the average person to do it effectively.</p>
                        <p>All of this makes a variable life insurance policy both a limited investment option and a limited life insurance option. As an investment vehicle, variable life insurance policies provide tax-free money to beneficiaries during the time that the policyholder is alive. Once that person dies, however, that money is retained by the insurance company. A variable policy can help cover funeral and end-of-life expenses, but other — and potentially simpler — policies do as well.</p>

                        <h4>Group Life Insurance</h4>
                        <p>Group life insurance is an employee benefit provided by some employers. It isn’t technically a life insurance type, but it’s important to know how it's different from privately purchased term life.</p>
                        <p>Group life insurance is most commonly term (although it can be whole). The real reason we bring it up, though, is that most people think their employer life insurance is enough, when in most cases it isn’t.</p>
                        <p>Make no mistake: If your employer is offering life insurance at no extra cost to you, it’s a great benefit. By all means, get insured. But if you need life insurance to protect your family, employer-provided coverage may not be sufficient.</p>
                        <p>Employer life insurance provides fairly low coverage, usually only one to two years’ worth of salary, when you could need $500,000 or more in coverage in order to meet your financial obligations.
                        <p>If you want to go for more, it’s likely to be more expensive than buying your own policy if you’re a person in relatively good health.
                            In short, don’t automatically pass up group life insurance, but don’t automatically dismiss other options, either. Make sure it fits your needs and see how you can work it into your private coverage.</p>
